# LEGO Project: Designed Experiment for Race Car Optimization

## Project Overview
This repository contains the results and analysis of the **LEGO Project**, conducted as part of the SCM 517 coursework. The objective was to design and optimize a LEGO race car using a **Designed Experiment (DOE)** to maximize the distance traveled after descending a ramp.

## Key Features
- **Experimental Setup**:
  - Designed and tested LEGO race cars with varying configurations.
  - Used a ramp with a consistent angle, height, and surface.
- **Factors Studied**:
  - Wheelbase length (Long/Narrow, Long/Broad).
  - Tire size (Big/Small).
  - Weight distribution (Front/Back).
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Conducted half-factorial DOE using Minitab.
  - Analyzed main effects and interactions between factors.
  - Evaluated trade-offs between performance and cost.
- **Optimization**:
  - Identified the most cost-effective and highest-performance car configurations.
